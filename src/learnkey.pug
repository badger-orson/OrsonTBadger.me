            p.paragraph-start.k  <b>Built in the early 1900â€™s,</b> the St. George, Utah, Main Street Theater had become rundown. With the Sketchup models I created we worked closely with the client, helping them envision office space for their new company, LearnKey. After being updated to modern-day seismic standards we redesigned the theater into an exciting new office space where old style meets new.
