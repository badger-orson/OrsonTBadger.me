        p.paragraph-start.r  <b>Before the economic downturn</b> in 2009 a developer from Las Vegas, NV. wanted to create the first mixed-use development in St George, UT. As part of the design team I helped develop the concept of a desert oasis. The lower levels of this development would provide underground parking for protection from the harsh sunny climate. The main street and second levels were designed for shops, museums, offices, and restaurants. Residential apartments and condominiums would be located on the higher levels and closer to the side of the hill, taking advantage of views of the city and desert landscape. The development was modeled with SketchUp and presentation renderings were created with embellished sketches, Photoshop, and markers.
